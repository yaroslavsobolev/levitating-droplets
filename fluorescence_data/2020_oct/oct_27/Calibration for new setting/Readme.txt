To enhanced the intensity of fluorescent signal for lower rhodamine B concentration, slit widths for exitation and emission are incresed. With this sdjustment the fluorescent intensity is enlarged about 60 times.


Data obtain
Three smaples are measured using new and old settings. Also measured using these two different settings are baseline and ORIE calibartion curves.

old setting:
   Slit Settings
   Ex: Entr: 2 nm, Exit: 2 nm
   Em: Entr: 2 nm, Exit: 2 nm
new setting:
   Slit Settings
   Ex: Entr: 8 nm, Exit: 8 nm
   Em: Entr: 4 nm, Exit: 4 nm
